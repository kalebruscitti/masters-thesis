	abstract = {Over a family \${\textbackslash}mathbb X\$ of genus \$g\$ complete curves, which gives the degeneration of a smooth curve into one with nodal singularities, we build a moduli space which is the moduli space of \$\{{\textbackslash}rm SL\}(n, {\textbackslash}mathbb C)\$ bundles over the generic smooth curve \$X\_t\$ in the family, and is a moduli space of bundles equipped with extra structure at the nodes for the nodal curves in the family. This moduli space is a quotient by \$({\textbackslash}mathbb C{\textasciicircum}*){\textasciicircum}s\$ of a moduli space on the desingularisation. Taking a "maximal" degeneration of the curve into a nodal curve built from the glueing of three-pointed spheres, we obtain a degeneration of the moduli space of bundles into a \$({\textbackslash}mathbb C{\textasciicircum}*){\textasciicircum}\{(3g-3)(n-1)\}\$-quotient of a \$(2g-2)\$-th power of a space associated to the three-pointed sphere. Via the Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem, the moduli of bundles on the smooth curve is a space of representations of the fundamental group into \$\{{\textbackslash}rm SU\}(n)\$ (the "symplectic picture"). We obtain the degenerations also in this symplectic context, in a way that is compatible with the holomorphic degeneration, so that our limit space is also a \$(S{\textasciicircum}1){\textasciicircum}\{(3g-3)(n-1)\}\$ symplectic quotient of a \$(2g-2)\$-th power of a space associated to the three-pointed sphere.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5249},
	abstract = {Let X be a smooth complex projective variety of dimension n equipped with a very ample Hermitian line bundle L. In the first part of the paper, we show that if there exists a toric degeneration of X satisfying some natural hypotheses (which are satisfied in many settings), then there exists a completely integrable system on X in the sense of symplectic geometry. More precisely, we construct a collection of real-valued functions H\_1, ... H\_n on X which are continuous on all of X, smooth on an open dense subset U of X, and pairwise Poisson-commute on U. Moreover, we show that in many cases, we can construct the integrable system so that the functions H\_1, ..., H\_n generate a Hamiltonian torus action on U. In the second part, we show that the toric degenerations arising in the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies satisfy all the hypotheses of the first part of the paper. In this case the image of the "moment map" {\textbackslash}mu = (H\_1, ..., H\_n): X to R{\textasciicircum}n is precisely the Okounkov body {\textbackslash}Delta = {\textbackslash}Delta(R, v) associated to the homogeneous coordinate ring R of X, and an appropriate choice of a valuation v on R. Our main technical tools come from algebraic geometry, differential (Kaehler) geometry, and analysis. Specifically, we use the gradient-Hamiltonian vector field, and a subtle generalization of the famous Lojasiewicz gradient inequality for real-valued analytic functions. Since our construction is valid for a large class of projective varieties X, this manuscript provides a rich source of new examples of integrable systems. We discuss concrete examples, including elliptic curves, flag varieties of arbitrary connected complex reductive groups, spherical varieties, and weight varieties.},

Moreover, we express the flip as the blow-up and blow-down of specific ideal sheaves, leading, under certain hypotheses, to a quite explicit description of the flip. We apply these ideas to various familiar moduli problems, recovering results of Kirwan, Boden-Hu, Bertram-Daskalopoulos-Wentworth, and the author. Along the way we display a chamber structure, following Duistermaat-Heckman, on the space of all linearizations. We also give a new, easy proof of the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition theorem.},

	abstract = {Toric varieties are algebraic varieties arising from elementary geometric and combinatorial objects such as convex polytopes in Euclidean space with vertices on lattice points. Since many algebraic geometry notions such as singularities, birational maps, cycles, homology, intersection theory, and Riemann-Roch translate into simple facts about polytopes, toric varieties provide a marvelous source of examples in algebraic geometry. In the other direction, general facts from algebraic geometry have implications for such polytopes, such as to the problem of the number of lattice points they contain. In spite of the fact that toric varieties are very special in the spectrum of all algebraic varieties, they provide a remarkably useful testing ground for general theories. The aim of this mini-course is to develop the foundations of the study of toric varieties, with examples, and describe some of these relations and applications. The text concludes with Stanley's theorem characterizing the numbers of simplicies in each dimension in a convex simplicial polytope. Although some general theorems are quoted without proof, the concrete interpretations via simplicial geometry should make the text accessible to beginners in algebraic geometry},

	abstract = {Given a stable parabolic bundle over a Riemann surface, we study the problem of finding a compatible Yang-Mills connexion. When the parabolic weights are rational there is an equivalent problem on an orbifold bundle. When the weights are irrational our method is to choose a sequence of approximating rational weights, obtain a corresponding sequence of Yang-Mills connexions on the resulting orbifold bundles and obtain the solution as the limit of this sequence: we need to consider mildly singular connexions which locally about a marked point take the form d - λ idθ + a. Here λ is a constant diagonal matrix whose entries depend on the weights and their rational approximations, θ = arg(z) for z a local uniformizing (orbifold) coordinate centred on the marked point and a is an L$_{\textrm{1}}$$^{\textrm{2}}$ connexion matrix. In this context we find all the necessary gauge-theoretic tools to prove the theorem, including a version of Uhlenbeck's weak compactness theorem, provided {\textbar}λ{\textbar} is sufficiently small. (One of the advantages of this approach is that we do analysis on a compact orbifold rather than on the punctured surface.) Our methods also allow us to consider the analogous problem for stable parabolic Higgs bundles.},

The stability condition involves a parameter; as it varies, we show that the moduli space undergoes a sequence of flips in the sense of Mori. As applications, we prove several results about moduli spaces of rank 2 bundles, including the Harder-Narasimhan formula and the SU(2) Verlinde formula. Indeed, we prove a general result on the space of sections of powers of the ideal sheaf of a curve in projective space, which includes the Verlinde formula.},
