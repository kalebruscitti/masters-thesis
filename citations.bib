This moduli space is a quotient by \$({\textbackslash}mathbb C{\textasciicircum}*){\textasciicircum}s\$ of a moduli space on the desingularisation. Taking a "maximal" degeneration of the curve into a nodal curve built from the glueing of three-pointed spheres, we obtain a degeneration of the moduli space of bundles into a \$({\textbackslash}mathbb C{\textasciicircum}*){\textasciicircum}\{(3g-3)(n-1)\}\$-quotient of a \$(2g-2)\$-th power of a space associated to the three-pointed sphere. Via the Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem, the moduli of bundles on the smooth curve is a space of representations of the fundamental group into \$\{{\textbackslash}rm SU\}(n)\$ (the "symplectic picture"). We obtain the degenerations also in this symplectic context, in a way that is compatible with the holomorphic degeneration, so that our limit space is also a \$(S{\textasciicircum}1){\textasciicircum}\{(3g-3)(n-1)\}\$ symplectic quotient of a \$(2g-2)\$-th power of a space associated to the three-pointed sphere.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5249},
	abstract = {Let X be a smooth complex projective variety of dimension n equipped with a very ample Hermitian line bundle L. In the first part of the paper, we show that if there exists a toric degeneration of X satisfying some natural hypotheses (which are satisfied in many settings), then there exists a completely integrable system on X in the sense of symplectic geometry. More precisely, we construct a collection of real-valued functions H\_1, ... H\_n on X which are continuous on all of X, smooth on an open dense subset U of X, and pairwise Poisson-commute on U. Moreover, we show that in many cases, we can construct the integrable system so that the functions H\_1, ..., H\_n generate a Hamiltonian torus action on U. In the second part, we show that the toric degenerations arising in the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies satisfy all the hypotheses of the first part of the paper. In this case the image of the "moment map" {\textbackslash}mu = (H\_1, ..., H\_n): X to R{\textasciicircum}n is precisely the Okounkov body {\textbackslash}Delta = {\textbackslash}Delta(R, v) associated to the homogeneous coordinate ring R of X, and an appropriate choice of a valuation v on R. Our main technical tools come from algebraic geometry, differential (Kaehler) geometry, and analysis. Specifically, we use the gradient-Hamiltonian vector field, and a subtle generalization of the famous Lojasiewicz gradient inequality for real-valued analytic functions. Since our construction is valid for a large class of projective varieties X, this manuscript provides a rich source of new examples of integrable systems. We discuss concrete examples, including elliptic curves, flag varieties of arbitrary connected complex reductive groups, spherical varieties, and weight varieties.},

	abstract = {This paper gives a construction of the moduli space of framed parabolic sheaves on a Riemann surface. This space serves as a universal, master, space for the well known moduli space of parabolic bundles, as well as moduli spaces of vector bundles, which can all be obtained from this space by torus quotients. The construction is given for the structure group SL(N, C), and indeed is adapted to this case. At the end of the paper, an approach is suggested for dealing with the case of arbitrary reductive groups, involving the associated loop group.},

	abstract = {We study the dependence of geometric invariant theory quotients on the choice of a linearization. We show that, in good cases, two such quotients are related by a flip in the sense of Mori, and explain the relationship with the minimal model program. Moreover, we express the flip as the blow-up and blow-down of specific ideal sheaves, leading, under certain hypotheses, to a quite explicit description of the flip. We apply these ideas to various familiar moduli problems, recovering results of Kirwan, Boden-Hu, Bertram-Daskalopoulos-Wentworth, and the author. Along the way we display a chamber structure, following Duistermaat-Heckman, on the space of all linearizations. We also give a new, easy proof of the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition theorem.},
