	We review the geometric quantization of the moduli space $\MM$ of flat $SU(2)$ connections on a compact Riemann surface in the real polarisation of Weitsman \cite{weitsman_real_1992}\cite{jeffrey_bohr-sommerfeld_1992}. We also use the methods of \cite{ramadas_comments_1989} to construct a line bundle over the toric variety $\cP$ associated to the moment polytope of Jeffrey and Weitsman's integrable system on the moduli space, which is compatible with the prequantum line bundle on $\MM$. There is a degeneration of the moduli space to this toric variety due to Biswas and Hurtubise \cite{biswas_degenerations_2021}, and we discuss how this degeneration might be used to prove results about the real and Kahler polarisations of the moduli space.
