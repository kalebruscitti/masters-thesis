\begin{document}
	In order to fit in the non-smooth fibres, with holonomy angles $0$ or $\pi$, we will consider a different perspective on the problem. Let us fix the holonomy around the boundary loops of a trinion, which we think of as a thrice-punctured sphere, and consider the space of connections with this fixed holonomy. Due to Mehta and Seshadri (cite) there is a correspondence between the moduli of $\pi_1(\Sigma)$ representations into $SU(2)$ and that of rank-2 holomorphic bundles with an $SL(2,\C)$ structure and a parabolic structure at the punctures of $\Sigma$, which we call a parabolic bundle. Under this correspondence, the eigenvalues of the holonomy get translated into a set of weights for the parabolic structure. 
	
	We want to consider the moduli space of connections with all possible holonomies, and therefore we will want to fit all these moduli of parabolic bundles together, and in such a way that we can even include the $\theta_i = 0,\pi$ cases, which will correspond to weights $0$ and $1$. 
\begin{definition}
	A \emph{parabolic bundle} over a complex manifold $\Sigma$ is a holomorphic vector bundle $E$ over $\Sigma$ with a \emph{parabolic structure}, which is a point of marked points $\{p_1,...,p_n\}$ and for each point, a flag of subspaces in the fibre $E_{p_k}$. 
\end{definition}
In particular if $E$ has rank 2, then a parabolic structure on $E$ is a choice of points $\{p_k\}$ and a sheaf homomorphism $\alpha:E\to S$ where $S := \bigoplus_{k} \C_{p_k}$.

There is an adapted notion of stability for parabolic vector bundles.
\begin{definition}
	Let $\gamma_1,...,\gamma_n \in [0,1]$ be a set of weights. For a subbundle (not neccesarily proper) $F$ of $E$ we set $\mu_i(F) = 1$ if $F_{p_i} \subset \ker\alpha_i$, and $\mu_i = 0$ otherwise. Define $\sigma(F) = \frac{1}{rk(E)}$ if $F=E$ and $0$ otherwise. Then we say a pair $(E,\alpha)$ is \emph{stable} with respect to $\gamma$ if 
	\begin{equation}
	rk(E)\deg(F) < rk(F)\left(\deg(E) - \sum_{i=1}^n \gamma_i\right) 
	+ rk(E)\sum_{i=1}^n(1 - \mu_i(F) + \sigma_i(F))\gamma_i.
	\end{equation}
	If the inequality is not strict, $(E,\alpha)$ is \emph{semi-stable}.
\end{definition}
